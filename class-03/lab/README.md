# LAB: Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

Using a Mongo Schema and Data Model, implement CRUD functionality to your note taking application

## Before you begin

Refer to _Getting Started_ in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

> Building off of your previous day's branch, create a new branch for today called 'mongo' and continue to work in your 'notes' repository.

Your app needs a new dependency today: mongoose

-   `npm i mongoose`
-   Remember to start your mongo server: `mongod --dbpath=/Users/path/to/data/db`

## Requirements

Add the following features to your Notes application:

-   When a user adds a new note, save it to the database

    -   i.e. `notes -add "This is fun" --category school`

-   Users should be able to list notes from the database

    -   All Notes: `notes --list` or `notes -l`
    -   Notes in a category: `notes --list school` or `notes -l school`

-   Users should be able to delete a single note
    -   `notes -d id-here`

> Note: Arguments that are full words such as `category`, `list`, `add` should be prefixed by **two** hyphens instead of one to be properly interpreted by `minimist`

## Implementation Notes

-   Your mongoose schema should have a minimum of 2 properties: text and category
-   If you want to store (or ask for) more information
    -   Ensure that add a new property and rules for it in your schema
    -   Alter (possibly) your input class to support new command line arguments
