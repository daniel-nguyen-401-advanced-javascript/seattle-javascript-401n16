## Lecture Overview

As we continue our deep dive into JavaScript, we have to learn of object-oriented programming. This class is focused on how modularity in our code can be improved with classes and inheritance. By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

-   [x] Understand the difference between pure functions, higher-order functions, and immutable state
-   [x] Understand the concept of object-oriented programming
-   [x] Understand class inheritance
-   [x] Have familiarity with the JavaScript error objects
-   [x] Create a class using ES6 class syntax
-   [x] Create and throw a custom JavaScript error

Prior to class, review the readings below and answer the discussion questions in your canvas reading assignment.

## Reading

Everything that you use in JavaScript can be thought of as an **object**. A variable that stores some data is an object, and JavaScript even lets you create a generic collection of key-value pairs, also referred to as an object.

JavaScript is both famously and infamously known as a language that "does not enforce type". What does this mean? Well, consider another language such as Java, where every variable must have a specific object type attached to it:

```java
String myStr = "Hello";
Integer myInt = 2;
Character myLetter = 'h';
Float myFloat = 3.45;
```

Once you define an object in Java, you can no longer change the variable to be of a different type. Thus, `myStr` can never be set to a number, and `myInt` can never be set to a string. JavaScript, on the other hand, does not care about the type of an object, and you can change it on the fly as needed:

```javascript
let myObject = 'Hello';

myObject = 2; // valid
myObject = 'h'; // valid
myObject = 3.45; // valid
```

Because JavaScript doesn't enforce type, you can get into strange situations where your variable is not containing the type of data that it should. These kinds of errors can become very hard to track and solve in large code bases.

Many programmers use **object-oriented programming** when developing; they categorize all of their data (stored as variables, aka objects) into distinct object types, that adhere to rules on what kind of data the object stores.

This methodology has been largely ignored by JavaScript developers, because historically there was no way within the language to enforce it. Now, JavaScript supports the creation of **classes**, which has allowed for object-oriented programming to be practiced.

A class defines a type of an object. Think of it as a standard JavaScript object, just with specific rules and one blueprint. Some classes even have functions that allow for data operations in a controlled way. And best of all, classes can be defined in relation to one another, making it simple to create rules on your data that only have to be defined once.

For example, let's say you wanted to create "Number", "Float" and "Integer" object types in JavaScript. You have a certain set of rules on what a valid "Number" is; there are only digits from 0-9 and possibly a negative sign or a decimal point. An "Integer" is a further rule on top of "Number": there can be no decimal point. A "Float" is also a further rule on top of "Number": it can accept a max of seven digits on either side of the decimal point. With classes and **inheritance**, you can quickly define these object types and their limitations.

We'll explore writing our own object types via classes in this lecture. We'll also touch upon some pre-existing classes in JavaScript you can use to your own advantage, and we'll briefly talk about ways to make your functions better and more professional using the concepts of **functional programming**.

### Handy Code Snippets

Feel free to skim these code snippets, they are mainly here for your reference after class lectures.

#### Pure Function

```javascript
function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
```

#### Higher-Order Function

```javascript
const arr2 = arr1.map(function(item) {
    return item * item;
});
```

#### Prototype Inheritance

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.walk = function() {};

function Bird(name) {
    Animal.call(this, name);
}

Bird.prototype.fly = function() {};
```

#### Class Inheritance

```javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    walk() {}
}

class Bird extends Animal {
    fly() {}
}
```

#### Try-Catch Block

```javascript
try {
    // do something with data
} catch (e) {
    // do something with error e
}
```

## Discussion Questions

Create a new markdown page in your reading notes repo for this class. On that page, answer the following questions. You will not be graded on correctness, but rather on your attempt to answer the question. Once you've created your new page, submit a link to that page using the canvas discussion entry field. Links should be somewhat of the format `https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/class-##-reading`.

1. What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?
2. What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type?
3. Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?
4. Describe a type of data that has rules, aside from the given examples of Number, Integer and Float. What are the rules the data should follow?
